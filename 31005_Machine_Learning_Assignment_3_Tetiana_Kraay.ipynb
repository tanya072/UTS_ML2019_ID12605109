        "\n",
        "Nowadays the world is connected via modern social networks like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and others. For instance, well-known ‘six degrees of separation’ theory (Milgram 1967) states that everyone on this planet is separated with another person with only six other people. This separation distance becomes even shorter with emerging such social network like Twitter which signifies the strong interlinking among users and definitely bring us with many benefits but also challenges. \n",
        "\n",
        "A tweet is the most basic message that spreads on Twitter social network. Tweets are interesting because they have some certain features: they are small in length (about up to 280 characters) which makes retweet operation lightweight and Twitter ideal information dissemination platform.\n",
        "\n",
        "To predict the popularity of tweet messages is important for a number of tasks such as breaking news, personalized message recommendation, viral marketing, generating donations and others. The prediction of popularity of tweets is not a novel idea but it was discovered that feature content or visual media is largely overlooked for the tweet popularity prediction problem. The report will investigate what kind of factors affect the messages propagation in Twitter, how all possible data modalities within these messages can be utilized to achieve better performance of predicting model and what problems related to predicting and constructing tweets can be indicated followed by ethical and social consequences of the study. \n",

        "#### Model description\n",
        "\n",
        "To predict whether a tweet will go viral or not Wang et al. (2018) describe in their study a multimodal neural network model that uses textual and visual content together with author’s social features. The social features of influential and active users can significantly increase the speed and breadth with what the tweet is spread across the net. Some experiments with tweets popularity prediction state that image features trained on deep networks improved the performance of prediction (Deza & Parikh, 2015) which inspired Wang et al. (2018) to combine visual, textual and social cues in their multimodal model. \n",
        "\n",
        "The model is constructed with two modules: pre-trained on ImageNet and fine-tuned on Twitter messages Convolutional Neural Network (CNN Inception-ResNet) for image modelling and specifically trained on tweet-style language Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM-RNN) for textual features extraction. The model then deep learns shared semantic relationships between text and image features using a joint-embedded model that map different modality features into one space (Figure 1.) A novel Poisson regression model for predicting retweet count based on all available data modalities where all feature content is used together with social cues to feed the Poisson Regression model. Retweet count then predicted in the dynamic scenario, where the early retweeting process is known with dynamics RNN model. Dynamics RNN model learns the temporal propagation of tweet and smoothly merges tweet’s content with social features of the user.\n",

        "\n",
        "To introduce another approach in tweet messages popularity prediction, the Retweet Predictive Model is chosen as an attempt to determine strong relation between specific features of tweets (Oliveira et al. 2019). The experiment aims two goals: investigate how distinct number of textual features can affect the tweet’s popularity and the second, is to find out whether the past activity of the user influences the tweet’s popularity or not. The classification model is constructed based on dividing the tweets on four classes, from Class 0 (no popularity or 0 retweets), Class 2 (low popularity less than 10), Class 3 (medium popularity from 10 to 100 retweets) and Class 4 (high popularity more 100 retweets). Tweets are collected with Twitter Streaming API and Twitter Search API followed by sentimental analysis and then dataset is split on training/test subsets and fitted to Random Forest classifier as a machine learning component of the model which includes 300 decision trees with 80/20 ratio (Figure 2).\n",

        "The dataset contains 12,470,144 tweets in English that collected in July 2016. Four classes of tweets are shown in Table 2 which clearly states that the dataset is imbalanced. The imbalanced dataset issue is quite common and needs to be fixed for further manipulation with data. To address the issue Oliveira et al. (2019) apply two different techniques for selecting training data: class balancing and sub-class balancing. \n",

User features include number of followers, statuses (tweets/retweets), favourites, times the user was listed, days of the account and binary feature whether the user is verified or not. Besides such tweet features as number of hashtags, URLs, mentions, length of the tweets, number of words in the tweet, is a tweet a reply, hour of the tweet timestamp, the new features are added: the number of videos, number of photos and GIFs. It is a sensible addition to the set of attributes since previous study (Wang et al. 2018) claims that users are more likely to be interested in tweets with visual content.\n",

        "It is seen from the Table 3 that class 1 and 4 illustrate the higher score for  short tweets. The results do not state clearly why classes 1 (not popular tweets) and 4 (highly popular tweets) perform better in any group of tweets, whether it is a result of imbalanced structure of the dataset or other reasons. \n",

        "\n",
        "Recent enforcing of strict security measures by major social networks such as Twitter and Facebook when only limited data can be requested through highly monitored API implementations was introduced after Cambridge analytical data scandal related to leaking the personal data of millions of Facebook users. Personal data release becomes the major ethical issue in the social networking world. People trust their sensitive and sometimes intimate information to the public online services where it can be misused or used in an illegitimate way. Most vulnerable users in this sense are influential users whose reputation can be damaged with creating fake accounts and spread illegitimate or provocative information from these accounts. To avoid this, influential users have an option to verify their accounts. However, the verification is only available for users with high retweet rate. Others are still under the threat of being exposed or defamed. To protect their users from exposing or misusing their personal information, in addition to enforced laws in accessibility of data from API, qualitative research in social media should be implemented in determining actionable tweets and users among of spam messages applying light and stateless algorithms. \n",
        "\n",
        "The social impact of social networking is hard to overestimate. From global challenge where users generate millions of dollars for charity needs to Twitter polls in news debates give Twitter audience the sense of inclusion and power to impact on life events. People in needs often reach the Twitter community for help. On the other hand, there are some disturbing signs of social networking popularity. Rough users such as extremists and spammers use networks for their illegal purposes and go unnoticed. Some people having issues with comparing themselves with influential users in the network, finding the sharply contrast between their life’s styles and become depressed, especially young people. \n",

        "\n",
        "Further developments in designing the viable classification model to predict the popularity of Twitter messages indicate even more findings and observations. Not only combination of identity/social/timing /topic features is important but also wording, precisely how the message is conveyed rather than what it contains, is crucial component on deciding how fast message will spread. In their studies Tan et al. (2014) discovered that the same user posts multiple tweets regarding the same URL within the short period of time. That explains that just mentioning URL in the message does not impact tweet’s virality but namely the description or wording in the tweet that increases the retweet rate. \n",
        "\n",
        "In contrary to experiments described above, some studies investigate the set of non-Twitter-specific features that can promote better construction of the message such as explicit request to retweet the message. Informativeness of the tweet is quite important as well but the message should be constructed in a concise and refined way. While distinctive or disruptive messages are more likely to be shared than others, tweets with conforming content have high chances to become popular too due to their familiarity. Imitating new headlines, using words or part of speech related to already popular tweets, including positive or negative opinion, easiness to read is not a complete list of techniques that according to many previous studies, have some degree of an impact on the message propagation.\n",
        "Understanding the fundamental psychological and cultural aspects should become a priority in establishing these features and attributes.\n"
